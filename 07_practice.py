# (1) add two numbers:

a = 5
b =10
# print (a+b)
print ("the sum of a + b",  a+b)



# (2) find reminder:

a = 4503
b = 15
print ("the reminder when a is divided by b is",a%b)



# (3) find a is greater than b or not:

a = 5
b = 20
print (a>b)
print (b>a)



# (4) find average of 2 numbers given by user

a = input ("enter first number:")
b = input ("enter second number:")
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
avg = (a+b)/2
print ("the avg of a and b is",avg)


# (5) calculate square of number entred by user

a = input ("enter number")
a = int (a)
print (a*a)
